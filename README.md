# Untitled C Game

Awesome game that I'm currently working on its written from scratch using only C99 and OpenGL.

> Version 0.2.1

## Changelog

- `v0.2.0`: Changed underlying implementation for `VGFX_Window`, it's no longer just a typedef for `GLFWwindow`.
- `v0.2.0`: General code refactoring.
- `v0.2.1`: Implemented camera movement to make debugging the scene easier.
